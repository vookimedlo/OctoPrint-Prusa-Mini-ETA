The [Octoprint][1] plugin for retrieving the estimated time of printing using the Prusa Mini/MK3s printer.

The estimated time will be accurate only if the gcode was generated by the [Prusa Slicer][2]
for the Prusa printer.

If the silent mode is enabled for your MK3s, you can activate the support in the settings of the plugin.

There are two methods available for getting the estimated printing time.

1. Read estimated time during the gcode file upload operation.
   The first Prusa Mini ETA code is read and used as the total time required for printing. 
   
   ![Approximate Total Print Time][total]
   
2. Read the estimated time during the printing.
   All codes being sent to the printer are analyzed and all ETA values are reported back to the Octoprint.

   ![Printing Time Left][left]

If either of the mentioned methods fails then the fallback mechanism shall leverage the original ETA computation.
